# 🚀 QRL Post-Quantum Secure GPU-Accelerated Homomorphic Encryption, ZKP & AI Agents

🔐 **Building the Future of Secure AI & Blockchain with Post-Quantum Cryptography & Zero-Knowledge Proofs** 🔐  

## **🌟 Overview**  
This open-source initiative by the **QRL Foundation** is focused on developing **post-quantum secure, GPU-accelerated homomorphic encryption (HE)** and **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)** to power **privacy-preserving AI agents** and **quantum-resistant applications**.  

## **🛠 Key Features**  
✅ **Post-Quantum Secure Encryption** – Leveraging NIST-approved PQC algorithms.  
✅ **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** – Enabling encrypted AI computation without decryption.  
✅ **GPU Acceleration** – Optimized HE and ZKP performance using CUDA and others.  
✅ **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)** – Privacy-enhancing cryptographic proofs without revealing sensitive data.  
✅ **Blockchain & Web3 Integration** – Quantum-resistant smart contracts and verifiable computations.  

## **🚀 Why It Matters**  
🔹 **Quantum Threat is Real** – Traditional encryption won’t survive quantum attacks.  
🔹 **AI Needs Security** – AI models often process sensitive data (e.g., financial transactions, medical records, and personal identifiers). Without strong encryption, this data is vulnerable to breaches, misuse, and unauthorized access. Post-quantum homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge proofs enable AI to compute on encrypted data without exposing raw information, ensuring privacy and security.  
🔹 **ZKP for Web3 & AI** – Prove statements without exposing data.  
🔹 **Performance Optimization** – GPU acceleration makes HE & ZKP practical.
